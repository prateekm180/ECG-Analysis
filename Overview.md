# What is the ECG signal?

The ECG signal is a continuous-time electrical voltage signal that represents the summed electrical activity of the heart as it depolarizes and repolarizes during each cardiac cycle. It is fundamentally a voltage (mV) vs time (ms) function, where both amplitude and timing encode physiological information. Distinct waveform components (P wave, QRS complex, T wave) correspond to specific electrical events in the heart and have clinical meaning.

Although ECG machines sample this signal digitally at a known sampling frequency, the underlying phenomenon is continuous and precise timing (especially of the QRS complex) is critical. Small errors in amplitude or temporal alignment can significantly alter derived metrics such as heart rate, conduction intervals, and rhythm interpretation. Therefore, an ECG is not merely a “shape,” but a quantitative physiological signal.
